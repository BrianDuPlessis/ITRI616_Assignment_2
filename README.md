<h1>Cliff Walker</h1>
<p>The Cliffwalker problem in the AI Gym environment presents a classic reinforcement learning challenge where an agent navigates a grid-world environment. 
The goal is to reach a target destination while avoiding falling off a cliff. This scenario often involves 
balancing the exploration of unknown territory with the risk of potential pitfalls, emphasizing the trade-off between maximizing rewards and minimizing risks.</p>

<p>This project solves the cliff walker problem by implementing Q-table-based reinforcement learning.</p>
