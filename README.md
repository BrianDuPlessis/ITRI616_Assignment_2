    <h1>Cliff Walker</h1>
    <p>The Cliffwalker problem in the AI Gym environment presents a classic reinforcement learning challenge where an agent navigates a grid-world environment. 
    The goal is to reach a target destination while avoiding falling off a cliff. This scenario often involves 
    balancing the exploration of unknown territory with the risk of potential pitfalls, emphasizing the trade-off between maximizing rewards and minimizing risks.</p>
    
    

    <br>
    <p>This project solves the cliff-walker problem outlined in the AI gymnasium, using Q-learning with grid search hyperparameter optimisation.</p>
